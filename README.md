# Activity-Recognition

This assignment investigates activity recognition using wrist-mounted accelerometer data during screwing operations. 
Two classification tasks are considered: 

  - Screwing Process Recognition: Classify between screwing and unscrewing activities.
  - Screwing Grip Recognition: Classify between two different grip types (tight vs loose) used during screwing.

The overall goal is to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline: prepare the data, extract meaningful features, train several machine learning models, and identify the best classifier for each task.
